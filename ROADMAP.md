## Implementation and Testing Notes

### Recent Matrix Improvements (March 2025)
- Added support for parsing matrices in LaTeX notation with `\begin{pmatrix}` environments
- Implemented matrix multiplication with `\cdot` operator in LaTeX
- Fixed tokenizer to properly handle `&` as matrix cell separator
- Basic parsing tests are now passing, but more advanced operations need refinement
- Some matrix operations (determinant, eigenvalues, rank, etc.) have implementations but require additional work
